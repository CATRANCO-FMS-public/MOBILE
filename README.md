# **Welcome to TransitTrack Mobile Application** ðŸ‘‹

## **About the Application**

This app is designed for Dispatchers. Their account credentials, which include the username and password on the mobile application, follow the format: `Surname_DateHired`. For example, if the surname is "Paler" and the date hired is March 12, 2025, the credentials would be `Paler_031225`.

The web application handles the account creation. As the admin starts inputting their employee credentials, it will automatically create their accounts.

**This application is built using React Native.**
